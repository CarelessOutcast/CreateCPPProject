# Simple Script to start a c++ Project

TODO
- Add simple Cmake instead of make 

## Motivation

I want to get a standard way of creating a c++ project; To make it faster for me
build rather than to set up the environment. I want something similar to an IDE
but I also want to learn how to build something from the ground up and manage it
myself; Henceforth, this small project was created.

## Usage

Build the binary, that creates a generic project template
``` 
make create
```

Once built, 
```
./create ProjectName
```
or add to the PATH and have access to it on the system!

```
create ProjectName
```
